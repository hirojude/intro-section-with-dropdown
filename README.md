## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project gave me the opporturnity to learn more about the position attribute, especially the "absolute" modifier. And also learnt the z-index and also the "order"  attribute.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.learnt {
  z-index:-1;
  flex-direction: column;
  box-shadow;
}
```
